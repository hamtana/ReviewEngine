# Review Engine

A lightweight review-collection system designed to capture customer feedback before it reaches public platforms. When a user submits a review below three stars, the system automatically prompts them to send an email instead. This allows the business to address issues directly and privately, improving customer experience while reducing negative public reviews.

## Technologies Used
- **Docker**
- **React.js**
- **Express.js**

The project is deployed on my VPS, and new review instances are dynamically generated on the website using JavaScript.

## Current Deployment
- **Nichol’s Website:** https://www.nichols.co.nz/Online-Reviews/Leave-a-Review
